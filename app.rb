# simplest example view we first define a URL route and 
# then return some content to be displayed
get '/' do
  'Hello world'
end

# as well as just return body content we can also set
# the HTTP headers directly. This view also demonstrates the use
# of erb templates, with local variables being exposed to the template
get '/index' do
  header 'Content-Type' => 'text/html; charset=utf-8'
  @page_title = "Title"
  @string = Sample
  erb :index
end

# as well as fixed URLs we can also take named variables
# this view uses a sample helper from the previously loaded
#Â helpers file
get '/param/:name' do
  bar(params[:name])
end

# splats allow for unnamed wildcard variables in urls
get '/splat/*/*' do
  params["splat"][0] + params["splat"][1]
end

# the redirect method throws a 302 redirect
# and works with local or remote URLs or fragments
get '/home' do
  redirect '/'
end

# if we want to specify the status code for a redirect we can
get '/force' do
  redirect '/', 301
end

# By default views will be served with a 200 status code but 
# you can always overide this if needed
get '/gone' do
  status 410

# sinatra provides a couple of useful defaul views for catching
# 404 not found errors

# the other useful default view is for catching 500 server errors
