Hello world, it's me Matt. I've had this domain for the better part of a decade but haven't regularly written in it. I'm
hoping to create more content that can help support others growth. Whether it's data science, meditation, startups,
psychology, I probably won't filter much.

While I have written two books on machine learning, finished half of another and have been presenting for years I just
haven't made it a goal to blog much. I'm hoping that this serves as a good place to put out ideas quickly and to a small
group of friends, family, and fools.

If you have any suggestions for what I should write about please let me know! I love feedback, because I love learning.
