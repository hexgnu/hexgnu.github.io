    <h2>Matt Kirk is:</h2>

    <h3 class='blue'>Analytical:</h3>
    <p>I've always been analytical.  When I was seven, I took my parent's VCR apart.  They got upset.  Eventually they cooled off when I put it back together and it still worked.</p> 

    <p>My love of analysis eventually led into me studying music.  While in school I would listen to to music and go home and figure out chord changes and apply them in the jazz band.</p>

    <p>While I didn't pursue music full time in college this love of analysis continued.  I studied applied mathematics and economics at the University of Washington.  This was because I am fascinated by challenges that are tough to figure out.  Economics is probably the toughest subject I've found.</p>

    <p>After graduating I started my career at Parametric Portfolio Associates as a quantitative research analyst.  While there I studied the effects of volatility as it relates to tax-loss harvesting.  The basic idea is how higher volatility will yield better harvesting opportunities for Parametric's clients.  This initial research was turned into a Russell Index after I left called CrossVol (crossvol.com).</p>

    <p>This theme has continued throughout my career as I have carved a niche for myself doing mathematics and statistics as it relates to programming.  Recently I was the Chief Scientist of SocialVolt in Kansas City.  Where I was in charge of running all research and development as it relates to social media data.</p>

    <p>Today I help business tackle hard to analyze problems with my company Modulus 7.  I am in the unique position of being one of the few individuals who knows both Ruby and math at an expert level.</p>  


    <h3 class='yellow'>Focused:</h3>
    <p>I focus on the customer.  When I was at UW, I typeset all my work in LaTeX.  Before doing this I wrote it all by hand and my teachers would write "Can't read on the work".  Instead of getting upset I decided to make it pretty and make them happy.  They definitely were and my grades went up as a result.</p>

    <p>I tend to only focus on what matters.  Throughout my entire career I work towards finding a solution instead of finding the best possible one.  When at Wetpaint we had a project that was running over budget and over time.  I kept pushing the team to interact more with the customer and to find a solution to the problems.  Eventually when we disbanded the project, we were able to restart under a much better system and interact with customers continuously instead of at the end.</p>

    <p>Instead of worrying about what the team wants, I always focus on delivering results.</p>
   

    <h3 class='grey'>Competitive:</h3>

    <p>Competition is a fact of business.  All of the companies I have worked with I have helped compete more effectively.  While at Wetpaint I was able to help them grow from 0 to 10 million uniques per month using a sophisticated publishing system.</p>
    <p>At Modulus 7 I pride myself in helping companies better position themselves in the market place and to overcome obstacles.</p>

    <h3 class='green'>Self-Taught:</h3>

    <p>I am always learning more.  When I was nine I read "The C Programming language".  It was tough to read, although I learned a lot.</p>
    <p>This love of learning has bled over into my career. Every single job I have had, I learn something new.  At Parametric I learned C#, at Wetpaint I learned Ruby, at SocialVolt I learned Javascript / CoffeeScript.  Over the course of my career I have done enterprise software to the open source software.  I am good about being thrown in the deep end and coming up just fine.</p>
