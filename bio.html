<div class='about'>
    <h2>Matt Kirk is:</h2>

    <h3 class='blue'>Analytical:</h3>
    <p>I have been analytical all my life.  When I was seven, I took my parents' VCR apart.  They got upset.  Eventually they cooled off when I put it back together and it still worked.  I earned two degrees from the University of Washington.  After UW I started my career researching quantitative finance.  The research I did is now used as the basis of the Russell CrossVol Index (crossvol.com).  Today I am one of the few Ruby programmers who uses math and statistics in their work.  I am analytical and love it.</p>  


    <h3 class='yellow'>Focused:</h3>
    <p>I focus on results.  When I was at UW, I typeset all my work using LaTeX.  This took twice as long but I improved my grades.  Instead of focusing on minutae I only care about getting the job done right and as quickly as possible.  I focus on results.</p>
   

    <h3 class='grey'>Competitive</h3>

    <p>I enjoy competition.  When I was in Boy Scouts, I was able to finish my Eagle Scout Award when I was thirteen.  Again when I was going to college I was able to finish a year early with two degrees.  While applying to Red Dirt RubyConf I won the presentation competition.  I can help you compete.</p>

    <h3 class='green'>Self-Taught</h3>

    <p>I am always learning more.  My life is full of learnig.  When I was nine I read "The C Programming language".  It was tough to read, although I learned a lot.  Ever since learning C++ twelve years ago I have enjoyed learning new programming languages every couple years.  I always read new material to improve my skills and help others.</p>
