    <h2>Matt Kirk is:</h2>

    <h3 class='blue'>Analytical:</h3>
    <p>Data production is growing at an alarming rate.  My skill with analysis can help you become more adept with data.</p>
    <p>I have been analytical all my life.  When I was seven, I took my parents' VCR apart.  They got upset.  They cooled off when I put it back together for them again and it worked.  When I at the University of Washington I earned both a mathematics degree and quantitative economics degree.  I started doing quantitative finance research.  My research was on the effects of volatility on tax-loss harvesting as well as momentum and reversal in emergent economies.  The initial research I did has turned into a Russell Index called CrossVol (crossvol.com).  My entire life has been analytical.</p>  


    <h3 class='yellow'>Focused:</h3>
     <p>Teams need focus.  I can help a team overcome challenges by focusing on what matters, results.</p>

    <p>I am focused on quality.  When I was in school, I was so focused to deliver my best work, I decided to typeset all my work with LaTeX.  This took twice as long but it was the best I could do and I was focused on delivering the best work possible.  Again I am always focused on the best quality work.</p>
   

    <h3 class='grey'>Competitive</h3>

    <p>I can help your business compete by finding advantages in your model and stimulating them.  When I was in Boy Scouts I started early so I was able to finish my Eagle Scout project before turning 14 and be one of two in the entire council to complete their award by 13.  Again when I was going to College I started two years early and was able to finish a year early with two bachelor of science degrees.  Together we can help your business compete more effectively by stimulating your advantages.</p>


    <h3 class='green'>Pragmatic</h3>

    <p>I love deliver value to my customers.  When my family owned an auto parts store, we all learned the lessons of keeping costs down, whether they be tangible or intangble so to give more room to grow and to deliver value.  Instead of focusing on every detail my entire life I focus on the results and value that people receieve.  

    <h3 class='black'>Self-Taught</h3>

    <p>We can always improve our current life with learning more.  My entire life has been filled with reading and learning from others.  When I was nine I read The C Programming language.  I didn't understand all of it but wanted to learn more about how computers worked.  I am constantly reading to learn more from others.  Together we can make amazing products and learn abundance.</p>
