<div class='about'>
    <h2>Matt Kirk is:</h2>

    <h3 class='blue'>Analytical:</h3>
    <p>I've always been analytical.</p>

    <p>Throughout my life I have studied music.  It is the perfect analysis exercise, because it requires creativity and a logical mind.  My collection of over two thousand albums helps me analyze the difference in musical genres as well as how music is created</p>

    <p>While I didn't pursue music as a career, I have become a creative engineer.  THis has been fufilled by programming as well as studying applied mathematics.  I would consider myself a pragmatic mathematician.</p>

    <p>I started my career at Parametric Portfolio Associates as a quantitative research analyst.  While there I studied the effects of volatility as it relates to tax-loss harvesting.  The basic idea is how higher volatility will yield better harvesting opportunities for Parametric's clients.  This initial research was turned into a Russell Index after I left called CrossVol (crossvol.com).</p>

    <p>This theme has continued throughout my career as I have carved a niche for myself doing mathematics and statistics as it relates to programming.  Recently I was the Chief Scientist of SocialVolt in Kansas City.  Where I was in charge of running all research and development as it relates to social media data.</p>

    <p>Today I help business tackle hard to analyze problems with my company Modulus 7.  I am in the unique position of being one of the few individuals who knows both Ruby and math at an expert level.</p>  


    <h3 class='yellow'>Focused:</h3>
    <p>I focus on the customer.  When I started my career I was the only person in my research group who would typset all of their work using LaTeX.  This was to please the customer and to help submissions to journals.  I was focused on making them happy as a customer of mine.</p>

    <p>I tend to only focus on what matters.  Throughout my entire career I work towards finding a solution instead of finding the best possible one.  When at Wetpaint we had a project that was running over budget and over time.  I kept pushing the team to interact more with the customer and to find a solution to the problems.  Eventually when we disbanded the project, we were able to restart under a much better system and interact with customers continuously instead of at the end.</p>

    <p>Instead of worrying about what the team wants, I always focus on delivering results.</p>
   

    <h3 class='grey'>Competitive:</h3>

    <p>Competition is a fact of business.  All of the companies I have worked with I have helped compete more effectively.  While at Wetpaint I was able to help them grow from 0 to 10 million uniques per month using a sophisticated publishing system.</p>
    <p>At Modulus 7 I pride myself in helping companies better position themselves in the market place and to overcome obstacles.</p>

    <h3 class='green'>Self-Taught:</h3>

    <p>I am always learning more.  I religiously study business and engineering books to learn more about running and operation of a business.  This has resulted in reading over half of the personal mba reading list (personalmba.com).  Many people are surprised that an engineer who never has gone to business school knows so much about business operation and strategy.</p>

    <p>This love of learning has bled over into my career. Every single job I have had, I learn something new.  At Parametric I learned C#, at Wetpaint I learned Ruby, at SocialVolt I learned Javascript / CoffeeScript.  Over the course of my career I have done enterprise software to the open source software.  I am good about being thrown in the deep end and coming up just fine.</p>
