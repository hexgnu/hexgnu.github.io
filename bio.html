    <h2>Matt Kirk is:</h2>

    <h3 class='blue'>Analytical:</h3>
    <p>Data production is growing at an alarming rate.  You need someone who is analytical to help you.</p>
    <p>I have been analytical all my life.  When I was seven, I took my parents' VCR apart.  They got upset obviously.  They cooled off, when I put it back together and it still worked.  I earned two science degrees from the University of Washington.  After UW I started my career doing quantitative financial research.  My research was on the effects of volatility on tax-loss harvesting as well as momentum and reversal in emergent economies.  The initial research I did has turned into a Russell Index called CrossVol (crossvol.com).  Today I am one of the few Ruby programmers who uses math and statistics frequently in their work.  I  am still analytical and love it.</p>  


    <h3 class='yellow'>Focused:</h3>
    <p>Teams need focus.  I can help you focus on results.  When I was at UW, I typeset all my work using LaTeX.  This took twice as long but I got better grades because of it.  I engineer what is needed and move on.  Instead of focusing on minutae I only care about getting the job done right and as quickly as possible.  I focus on results.</p>
   

    <h3 class='grey'>Competitive</h3>

    <p>I can help you compete.  When I was in Boy Scouts I started a year early. I was able to finish my Eagle Scout when I was 13.  Again when I was going to College I started two years early and was able to finish a year early with two degrees.  While applying to Red Dirt RubyConf I used my network to help me win the presentation competition.  Together I can help you compete.</p>


    <h3 class='green'>Pragmatic</h3>

    <p>I am a realist.  My family learned the lesson of being pragmatic when we owned an auto parts store.  Instead of buying too many parts which were inexpensive, we bought what we needed.  We eventually sold the store at a tidy profit.  I am realistic and will achieve results.</p>

    <h3 class='black'>Self-Taught</h3>

    <p>I am always learning more.  My life is full of learnig.  When I was nine I read "The C Programming language".  It was tough to read, although I learned a lot.  Ever since learning C++ twelve years ago I have enjoyed learning new programming languages every couple years.  I always read new material to improve my skills and help others.</p>
