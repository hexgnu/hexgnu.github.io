I&rsquo;ve had this domain for the better part of a decade but haven&rsquo;t regularly written in it. I&rsquo;m
hoping to create more content that can help support others growth. Whether it&rsquo;s data science, meditation, startups,
psychology, I probably won&rsquo;t filter much.</p><p>While I have written two books on machine learning, finished half of another and have been presenting for years I just
haven&rsquo;t made it a goal to blog much. I&rsquo;m hoping that this serves as a good place to put out ideas quickly and to a small
group of friends, family, and fools.</p><p>If you have any suggestions for what I should write about please let me know! I love feedback, because I love learning.</p></article></main><footer id=footer>Copyright Â© 2021 Matthew Kirk</footer></body></html>
